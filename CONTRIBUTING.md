## Technical Setup

The architecture is inspired by https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md

Check out [the `intellij-rust` repo](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust) in general for how the `intellij-elm` testing is set up and how the project is structured. Also good for examples of how to use the Intellij SDK. The people who built this originally are now JetBrains employees. There are also [some helpful blog posts](https://kobzol.github.io/) written by an intellij-rust maintainer.

The [Intellij SDK docs](https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/intro/welcome.html) are a great reference, both for getting started and for more advanced features.
